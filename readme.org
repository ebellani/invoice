#+title: Invoice in multiple currencies

* Why

  The point of this project is to help you craft an invoice that
  involves multiple currencies. It is initially geared towards
  presenting the final result in bitcoins, but that is easy to change.

* What

  This is an orgmode file that uses python to generate more
  data. Think of it as a python notebook thing.

* Requirements

  - Emacs 24
  - Python 2
  - [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/openexchangerates][openexchangerates.org python API client]]

* How

  Just run

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    make sample.html
  #+END_SRC

  To generate an HTML invoice of the sample. Edit the initial table
  with your and your client's information, and add your expenses and
  their respective currencies in the table named ~input_table~. To see
  the valid currency codes, see the [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/openexchangerates][documentation]] for the API client.
